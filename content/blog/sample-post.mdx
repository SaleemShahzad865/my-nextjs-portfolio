# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 is the latest version of the popular React framework for building web applications. This guide will walk you through setting up a new Next.js project and exploring its key features.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides a great developer experience with features like:

- **File-based routing** - Create pages by adding files to the pages directory
- **Server-side rendering** - Better SEO and performance
- **Static site generation** - Generate static pages at build time
- **API routes** - Build backends with serverless functions

## Installation

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
```

This command will set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and the App Router.

## Key Features

### App Router

The App Router is the new way to handle routing in Next.js 14. It uses React Server Components by default for better performance.

### Server Components

Server Components run on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size and improving initial page load times.

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 makes building modern web applications easier than ever. With its powerful features and excellent developer experience, it's a great choice for your next project.
